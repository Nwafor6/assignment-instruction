						<li>If you want to take this opportunity to improve programming skills,
							<ol>
								<li>Mostly, it is due to a typo that you have overlooked.</li>
								<li>In case of compile errors, understand the meaning of the error message, locate the cause of the errors,  and fix them.</li>
								<li>In case of logic errors (incorrect results), use the debugger to trace the program execution and locate the cause of logic errors.</li>
